            <p> I chose Alexis Persani as an inspiration because of his imaginative use of 3D typography and surreal digital compositions that challenge conventional visual boundaries. 
                His ability to blend realism with fantasy through bold color, dynamic textures, and intricate detail transforms static designs into captivating visual stories. Persani’s 
                work is not only technically masterful but also emotionally engaging, often giving everyday subjects a sense of wonder and depth. This aligns with my interest in designing web 
                experiences that go beyond basic interaction—toward spaces that surprise, delight, and spark curiosity. His unique approach to combining typography with abstract visuals resonates 
                with my desire to explore the expressive potential of type and motion in digital design. By merging art and technology in visually rich ways, Persani encourages experimentation and 
                narrative, values I aim to carry into my own web-based projects.

            <p> Andy Warhol is a strong inspiration for my web design class due to his abstract visuals and bold use of color. His iconic pop art style, rooted in 
                repetition, contrast, and popular culture, translates effectively to digital design. Warhol’s work challenges conventional boundaries between art 
                and commerce—an approach that encourages creative freedom in layout, typography, and interactivity. I’m particularly drawn to how his use of vibrant, 
                unexpected color combinations creates strong visual impact, something I aim to reflect in my own design choices. His ability to turn everyday subjects 
                into striking visuals inspires me to experiment with how graphics and layout can elevate user experience online.

            <h1>BAUHAUS</h1>
            <h2>1919</h2>
            <p>

            <p> 
            </p>

            <p> The Bauhaus was a groundbreaking design school founded in 1919 in Weimar, Germany, by architect Walter Gropius. 
                It sought to unify art, craft, and technology, promoting the idea that design should serve society and be functional. 
                Rejecting decorative excess, the school embraced simplicity, geometric forms, and clean lines, championing the 
                principle that "form follows function." The Bauhaus movement significantly influenced architecture, graphic 
                design, product design, and typography. Its faculty and students—including Paul Klee, Wassily Kandinsky, and 
                Marcel Breuer—emphasized experimentation and interdisciplinary collaboration. Iconic Bauhaus works often feature 
                modular structures, sans-serif typography, and a minimalist aesthetic. Although the school was closed by the 
                Nazis in 1933, its legacy continued to spread globally as key figures emigrated. Today, Bauhaus principles 
                remain deeply embedded in contemporary design practices across disciplines.
            </p>Bauhaus has been a lasting source of inspiration in my design journey. In this course, its influence became 
                particularly evident in the layout of my website. For instance, in Workbook 2C, I incorporated color-coded buttons 
                for navigation between pages—a subtle nod to Bauhaus ideals. I’m especially drawn to designs that use minimal 
                structures with strategic use of color to convey personality and function, reflecting the timeless appeal of the 
                Bauhaus philosophy.

            <p>Closer is a creative agency who created the Comme des Garçons (CDG) website. They specialise
                in crafting immersive digital experiences and has collaborated with various luxury brands. 
                The Comme des Garçons (CDG) website places a strong emphasis on visual design and interactivity, 
                enhancing the user experience by inviting visitors to engage with the site in a playful and 
                unconventional manner. Deeply rooted in the brand’s ethos of rebellion and experimentation, 
                the website departs from standard fashion e-commerce practices. Instead, it presents itself 
                more as a digital installation or conceptual artwork than a traditional online store. This 
                approach closely aligns with the vision of the brand’s founder, Rei Kawakubo, who once stated: 
                “Creation takes things forward. Without anything new, there is no progress.”
            </p>From the moment I first encountered the CDG website, I was immediately captivated by its 
                distinctive graphics and interactive elements. Small details—such as floating product 
                images—transform the browsing process into an immersive experience. Notably, the absence of 
                conventional navigation initially created a sense of disorientation, prompting a deeper level 
                of curiosity and engagement. This unconventional structure not only challenges the viewer but 
                also invites exploration, reinforcing the brand’s avant-garde identity."

            <h2>2019</h2>

            <p> 
            </p>
            <p> Daniel Wenzel's <em>Automated Type Design</em> project was developed in 2019 as part of his thesis at HTWG Konstanz 
                in Germany. The project investigates the intersection of automation, artificial intelligence, and type design, 
                resulting in the creation of over 100 typefaces within a 16-week period. The accompanying website serves as an 
                interactive showcase of his thesis and was launched in conjunction with the project’s exhibition at the Werkschau 
                HTWG Konstanz during the summer of 2019. The site outlines Wenzel’s five-step framework for automating type 
                design—Form, Systematics, Extension, Refinement, and Variation—and features numerous examples of typefaces generated 
                using both systematic and AI-driven processes. This work demonstrates Wenzel’s innovative approach to integrating 
                technology with creative practice and contributes meaningfully to the evolving conversation around automation in 
                design..
            </p>What stands out to me is his effective incorporation of experimental graphics throughout the website, which highlights 
                the depth of his process. By integrating advanced technology into his design methodology, Wenzel successfully elevates the 
                final visual outcomes. One particularly striking example involves a large-scale digital installation composed of nine 
                interconnected screens forming a cohesive visual piece. As someone who appreciates a monochromatic color palette, I was 
                especially drawn to his ability to achieve contrast, texture, and tonal variation using minimal color. The animated 
                components of the website were also a source of inspiration for me — elements I drew from and applied in my own work 
                during Weeks 7 and 8 of this course.

            <p> I chose THE LUME Melbourne as an inspiration because of its ability to immerse the audience and transport them into 
                an entirely different world through the power of installation art. Its large-scale, multi-sensory experiences combine 
                projection, sound, and even scent to reimagine traditional artworks in innovative, interactive ways. This immersive 
                approach transforms the act of viewing art into a full-body experience, allowing visitors to engage with visual 
                culture on a deeper, more emotional level. I find this particularly compelling for web design, as it encourages 
                thinking beyond flat screens—toward creating environments that envelop users and evoke strong sensory responses. 
                The way THE LUME brings static images to life and crafts narrative-driven spaces deeply aligns with my desire to 
                design digital platforms that feel experiential, rather than purely functional.

            <p> Pulse Room is an interactive installation by artist Rafael Lozano-Hemmer that transforms biometric data into 
                a mesmerizing visual experience. The artwork features a room filled with hundreds of incandescent light bulbs, 
                each flashing in sync with the heartbeat of a participant. When a viewer places their hand on a sensor, their 
                pulse is detected and translated into a rhythm of light, which is then added to the sequence of previous 
                participants’ pulses.
                This piece explores the relationship between technology, human presence, and collective memory. The simplicity 
                of the visual concept—light blinking to the rhythm of a heartbeat—makes the experience deeply personal and 
                emotionally resonant. I find Pulse Room inspiring for digital design because of how it merges data, interactivity, 
                and minimalism into something poetic. It reminds me that design can be both functional and emotionally driven, 
                using technology not just for utility but for creating immersive, human-centered experiences.

            <p> Studio Round’s ability to blend storytelling with strong visual identity deeply inspires me. Their work is consistently 
                refined, purposeful, and concept-driven. I admire how they balance minimalism with boldness, always considering brand 
                context. Their design approach encourages me to think more strategically and emotionally in my own creative process.

            <p> Studio Ongarato is a Melbourne-based, internationally recognised design studio renowned for its innovative approach to 
                branding, wayfinding, placemaking, and experiential environments. Established in 1993 by Creative Director Fabio Ongarato 
                and Director Ronnen Goren, the studio has consistently challenged conventional design norms, crafting culturally influential 
                brands and experiences over the past three decades. With offices in Melbourne, Hong Kong, and the Americas, Studio Ongarato 
                operates across diverse sectors, including hospitality, property, arts, and culture. Their multidisciplinary team comprises 
                designers, curators, editors, architects, art directors, and craftspeople, collaborating closely with leading artists and 
                artisans to deliver unique and compelling outcomes for each project. Notable projects include branding and environmental 
                graphics for the Jackalope Hotel, wayfinding systems for the Western Australian Museum, and identity design for the 
                National Gallery of Australia. The studio's work is characterised by a rigorous, strategic interrogation of brand and 
                context, aiming to connect on an experiential level that elevates clients to the forefront of cultural influence. 
            <p> Studio Ongorato has made outstanding projects that I take great inspiration from. I chose Studio Ongarato as inspiration 
                because of their bold, conceptual approach to design that seamlessly blends storytelling, spatial experience, and visual 
                identity. Their work pushes boundaries and engages audiences emotionally, which aligns with my own goals to create meaningful, 
                immersive design outcomes that go beyond conventional aesthetics.

            <p> I chose the Yayoi Kusama exhibition at the National Gallery of Victoria (NGV) as a source of inspiration because of its bold use 
                of repetition, color, and immersive installation art. Kusama's signature polka dots, mirrored environments, and vibrant, large-scale 
                works create an otherworldly atmosphere that blurs the boundary between the viewer and the artwork. Her ability to transform entire 
                spaces into dreamlike experiences resonates with my interest in creating web designs that feel interactive and all-encompassing. 
                The NGV exhibition, in particular, invited visitors to become part of the artwork, encouraging playfulness and emotional engagement. 
                This approach inspires me to think of digital platforms not just as tools, but as spaces where users can feel visually and emotionally 
                immersed. Kusama’s fearless creativity and commitment to a unique visual language challenge me to embrace boldness and repetition in 
                my own work, using design to evoke wonder and connection.
